This directory is formatted to have 
/
  imgs/
  subs/
  archive.h5
  | other .h5 files
  v

So that:
  imgs/ directory has all of our images that are larger than 80x145, usually 1160x640.
  subs/ directory has all of our images that are individual subsections, 80x145 (or 145x80)
  and finally our archive.h5 (and any other .h5 files) come from our live system, where it stores the new classifications
